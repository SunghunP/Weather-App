## Purpose:
A small Project to show my cumulative knowlege of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX, and API calls.  

## Website
Here is a link to the webpage! Please bookmark or save this page if you would like to see future updates!

## Requirements 
I used the free api provided by openweathermap.org to tget all of the weather data displayed in the project. This includes the images which they documented in their API documentation.

You can sign up and get a free api key by visiting the link provided
https://openweathermap.org/api

I also used the latest version of jQuery which can be found here: https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.0.js

## Usage and Features
This is a webpage that allows the user to search the current weather, temperature, humidity, and a bit more! They can view any city within the data base of the openweathermap.org API

## Future Updates
- In the future I hope to add the bonus functionality of saving a search history or appending the new searched cities into the top of the page. 
- I would also like to make the page more appealing by tweaking with the CSS. 
- Another piece of functionality I would like to add is the ability to save the cities searched in a user profile and view multiple cities at once. 

## Updates
#### 3/25/2022
> Change a lot of the css to make the website much more responsive to smaller screen or resizing the screen. Also tweaked the Javascript file a bit to use constant variables until I want to create updates on appending divs into the DOM instead of reling on already created ones. Add lots of images and links to showcase what the website will look like.
